    lyrics: `
[Verse 1]
Day is young, sun gonna shine
Bubbles go dance, and let's rewind (the sun gonna shine x 2)

Live through the dark, let it be bright
Let the pages turn, and the breeze blow by (the sun gonna shine x 2)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's moving, as the sun comes up
Everybody's moving, as the sun comes up

[Chorus]
The Best Is Yet To Come (though our younger days are gone)

[Verse 2]
Her hair come down, sun gonna shine
Shades on my brow, stop me going blind (the sun gonna shine, and we rewind x 2)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's moving, as the sun comes up
Everybody's moving, as the sun comes up

[Chorus]
The Best Is Yet To Come (oh nana)

[Bridge]
Hold on too long, and you might lose your mind
Learn how to fall, give it another try
Hold on too long, and you might lose your mind
Learn how to fall, give it another try

[Chorus]
The Best Is Yet To Come (oh nana)
